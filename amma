1. Version of Current OS of Linux : hostnamectl

2. List network interfaces in Linux : ifconfig -a                               or
			       ip link show                           or
			       ip addr                                    or
			       ls /sys/class/net                       or

3. List network interfaces using netstat command :      netstat -i

4. List network interfaces using nmcli command :        nmcli device status

5. Here are some common use cases for the ip command.

           	To show the IP addresses assigned to an interface on your server:

		[root@server ~]# ip address show 

	To assign an IP to an interface, for example, enps03:

		[root@server ~]# ip address add 192.168.1.254/24 dev enps03

	To delete an IP on an interface:

		[root@server ~]# ip address del 192.168.1.254/24 dev enps03

	Alter the status of the interface by bringing the interface eth0 online:

		[root@server ~]# ip link set eth0 up

	Alter the status of the interface by bringing the interface eth0 offline:

		[root@server ~]# ip link set eth0 down

	Alter the status of the interface by changing the MTU of eth0:

		[root@server ~]# ip link set eth0 mtu 9000

	Alter the status of the interface by enabling promiscuous mode for eth0:

		[root@server ~]# ip link set eth0 promisc on

	Add a default route (for all addresses) via the local gateway 192.168.1.254 that can be reached on device eth0:

		[root@server ~]# ip route add default via 192.168.1.254 dev eth0

	Add a route to 192.168.1.0/24 via the gateway at 192.168.1.254:

		[root@server ~]# ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.254

	Add a route to 192.168.1.0/24 that can be reached on device eth0:

		[root@server ~]# ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0

	Delete the route for 192.168.1.0/24 via the gateway at 192.168.1.254:

		[root@server ~]# ip route delete 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.254

	Display the route taken for IP 10.10.1.4:

		[root@server ~]# ip route get 10.10.1.4

7. To Know CPU of a server : lscpu  or nproc

8.To check Memory of a Server/ Machine : free -h

9. To check the Load of a server : top

10. To check the Load average  of a server : uptime

11. To check Size of the file  : du -sh name of the file   

12. To check highest Size of the file  : du -sh * | sort -rh | head -10
