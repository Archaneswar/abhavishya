Kibana
Kibana is an open-source analytics and visualization tool that was created particularly to interact with Elasticsearch. The most common uses of Kibana are searching, viewing, and interacting with data stored internally in Elasticsearch indices.

Splunk
Splunk is a sophisticated platform for analyzing machine data, especially logs generated frequently but seldom used effectively. Splunk is used for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data using a web-based interface. It compiles all pertinent data into a central index that allows users to find the required information quickly.
Features:
•	It enables the examination of data from networks, servers, apps, and various other data sources.
•	It is simple enough to deploy in a production environment.
•	It provides attributes such as Splunk light to transfer data from many servers to the main Splunk engine for analysis.
•	It indexes data in such a way that it produces powerful analytic insights.
•	Its reports are accurate to the decimal point, allowing any organization to identify steps for improvement and take action, if necessary.
